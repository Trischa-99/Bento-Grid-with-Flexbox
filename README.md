## My Process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to overcome all the unexpected little problems until I was satisfied with the result.

It was challenging but also interesting to work without a Figma file, relying only on my eyes for measurement. I’m sure I would have been much faster with a Figma file, but my understanding of CSS wouldn’t have grown as much if I had used one.

My favorite is this small piece of code I wrote to push the < symbol a bit higher. I struggled with it more than I probably should have, but I’m proud to have found a solution - even if the result doesn’t change much in the grand scheme of things.

```css
.audience-header span {
  position: relative;
  top: -4px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep refining my styling skills even further. There’s still so much to learn, and I’m already really excited to do so.
